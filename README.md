# dotfiles
my dotfiles, by request; mostly derived from others, hopefully always credited.

I haven't tried to set up a new system using these, and I know there are at least a few files outside .config referenced, but they're either part of someone else's repo, or pretty specific to my work, and probably not useful.  But feel free to ask if something is unclear or uncredited.

There is no license file, because I used bits and pieces (sometimes large, like the polybar config) from elsewhere that have their own licenses; they were all permissive, though
